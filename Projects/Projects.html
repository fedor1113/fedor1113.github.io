					<h2>SomeBasicMathsNotions</h2>
					<p>
						SomeBasicMathsNotions is a small reference website I&apos;ve made for Russian mathematics students and enthusiasts who are only beginning to study algebra. It explains some basic and important algebraic concepts. The source is available on my Github page. The website can be found at <a href="https://fedor1113.github.io/SomeBasicMathsNotions/">this location</a>.

					<h2>LlIF</h2>
					<p>
						<abbr>LlIF</abbr> (Linux loves Interactive Fiction) is a tiny script to add <abbr title="interactive fiction">IF</abbr> support in GNU/Linux <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr> (it works best for Debian-based distros). It adds appropriate story file MIME-types with icons to <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr> and attempts to install software from Debian repos. For more information see <a href="https://fedor1113.github.io/LlIF/">LlIF website</a>.

					<h2>LineCodes</h2>
					<p>
						Line Codes from PNG images converter is a raw and small Jupyter <a href="https://github.com/fedor1113/LineCodes/">script</a> made for a very specific task. Some parts are unfinished, but it does what it was designed to do. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_code">Wikipedia article on line codes</a>.
