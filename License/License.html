                <p>
                    This web-site with all the content is libre, free, open-source and in public domain &mdash; mostly. You can <a href="https://github.com/fedor1113/fedor1113.github.io">fork me on Github</a>. If you wish to use some part of this web-site or it as a whole &mdash; for some materials, the licensing may vary; you should always look for licence notices on the page you are interested in &mdash; first. If not otherwise noted, the licensing terms are briefly described in the following paragraph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the content is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal if not otherwise noted. As there might be some software templates or discussions about programming on this website, there are 3 major licences that will be used if not otherwise noted: for all non-software content &mdash; CC0 1.0 Universal, for software (programs and code) &mdash; MIT licence and for less than 20 lines of code &mdash; Fair licence. All of the licences are permissive and fairly basic &mdash; they allow distribution, commercial use etc. (read LICENSE file for more info).
