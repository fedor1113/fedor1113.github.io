					Hello, webfarer! It seems that in your tireless exploration of the farthest and least travelled corners of the Internet you have somehow stumbled upon <i>fedor1113's</i> personal web-site during a sudden impulsive binge of giving original names to everything that was around, named <i>Superfluous Instantiation</i>. So its creator can only say, &quot;Welcome!&quot; <i>(and humbly hope that you will find something interesting here)</i>.

                <h1>About myself</h1>
                <section>
                    <h2>How I define myself</h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>I am a secular humanist</dt>
                        <dd>The Quest for Truth is the most important mission of the human race to date. By finding the best approximations of the truth and making scientific predictions we make our lives better and happier. I am a rationalist, a Bayesian. I try to be skeptical about the ideas that surround me and question my beliefs. I am of the opinion that human life has the highest value of all things &mdash; as it encompasses them (in the sense that it allows us to experience them). Life is so full of new discoveries, small wonders and joys... And every single day we get closer to understanding how all of it works... That is truly fascinating.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a hacker</dt>
                        <dd>A hacker mostly in the original sense of the word (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker" title="Wikipedia article on hackers">Wikipedia article on the topic</a>). Let us be frank here. We all know this: computers are <em>cool</em>. Practically all that our society produces these days is made with their help. I adore those infinitely complex machines that can compute at speeds that we cannot even begin to imagine. The design possibilities are also amazing. The interfaces of today are so beauteous and sleek that they leave me overwhelmed. All this is possible because of computers. I love the freedom they give you. The control. Every single line of code. Every bit of information. All of it is controlled by the user on a truly free (<em>libre</em>) machine.</dd>
                        <dt>I am an optimist</dt>
                        <dd><q>No problem is insoluble in all conceivable circumstances.</q> It is one rare case where the validity of the statement is not so important. Considering the inventiveness of the human mind and the randomness+complexity of the universe if you need to solve a problem, <abbr title="in my humble opinion">IMHO</abbr>, it tends to be beneficial to believe that there is always a solution &mdash; as otherwise you cannot do anything, so doubting your abilities either equals hindering your progress or does not matter &there4; to maximize utility you need not lose hope. At least that is a good heuristic I try to use every day.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a programmer</dt>
                        <dd><code>&lbrace;Code&rbrace;</code> is fun! <abbr title="object-oriented programming">OOP</abbr> is neat, <abbr title="functional programming">FP</abbr> is divine. I love coding. Creating new products and designing new interfaces, helping other people across the globe, collaborating, solving interesting problems, banging your head against the wall when bugs won't go away until (finally) getting rid of them &mdash; that is what life should be like. I am a pythonist. I love <i>Python 3</i>. I also sometimes write code in <i>C++</i> and <i>JavaScirpt</i>.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a free (<i>libre</i>) software activist</dt>
                        <dd>To quote <cite>Linus Torvalds</cite>, <q>Talk is cheap. Show me the code.</q> Also it is <a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/" title="link to 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' book web-site">said</a> that <q>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</q> &mdash; a statement known as <i>Linus's Law</i>. Using <abbr title="free/libre and open-source software">FLOSS</abbr> is a question of security, usability and freedom. I have a right to know what is happening on my machine &mdash; it is mine and it should do what I tell it to do and no more. The code that only a few people edit is bound to be buggy (thus &mdash; the quality of proprietary software is low) and &there4; insecure (full of undiscovered vulnerabilities) &mdash; not even considering potential backdoors left by developers themselves. Moreover, I have a right to adjust my machine to my needs, as (occasionally) I need to modify the code etcetera. I fully support Richard Stallman's cause.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a digital privacy advocate and a cryptography enthusiast</dt>
                        <dd>Privacy is important. It is your life and only you should decide which parts to share with others and which to leave to yourself.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a web-developer</dt>
                        <dd><b>Code the Web!</b> <i>HTML 5</i> is incredible. It (together with <i>CSS 3</i>) is just awesome and it is growing and evolving very fast. You can do very impressive things with it. Though Internet (in and of itself), <abbr title="in my humble opinion">IMHO</abbr>, is stuck. To my mind, a true system for sharing and storing information globally should be decentralized (like <a href="https://ipfs.io/" title="'InterPlanetary File System' a.k.a. IPFS peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol home page">IPFS</a>). I made some minor contributions to the creation of <a href="https://www.webplatform.org/"><i>WebPlatform.org</i></a> and consider following web standards to be very important.</dd>
