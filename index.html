				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>
					Hello, webfarer! It seems that in your tireless exploration
					of the farthest and least travelled corners of the Internet
					you have somehow stumbled upon <i>fedor1113&apos;s</i>
					personal website, during a sudden impulsive binge of giving
					original names to everything that was around, named
					<i>{{ site.title }}</i>. So its cre&auml;tor can only say,
					&lsquo;Welcome!&rsquo; <i>(and humbly hope that you will
					find something interesting here)</i>.

                <h1>About myself</h1>
                <section>
                    <h2>How I define myself</h2>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>I am a secular humanist</dt>
                        <dd>The Quest for Truth is the most important mission of
							the human race to date. By finding the best
							approximations of the truth and making scientific
							predictions we make our lives better and happier.
							I am a rationalist, a Bayesian. I try to be
							sceptical about the ideas that surround me and
							question my beliefs. I am of the opinion that human
							life has the highest value of all things &mdash; as
							it encompasses them (in the sense that it allows us
							to experience them). Life is so full of new
							discoveries, small wonders and joys&hellip; And
							every single day we get closer to understanding how
							all of it works&hellip; That is truly
							fascinating.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a hacker</dt>
                        <dd>A hacker mostly in the original sense of the word
							(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker"
							title="Wikipedia article on hackers">Wikipedia
							article on the topic</a>). Let us be frank here.
							We all know this: computers are <em>cool</em>.
							Practically all that our society produces these days
							is made with their help. I adore those infinitely
							complex machines that can compute at speeds that we
							cannot even begin to imagine. The design
							possibilities are also amazing. The interfaces of
							today are so beauteous and slick that they leave me
							overwhelmed. All this is possible because of
							computers. I love the freedom they give you. The
							control. Every single line of code. Every bit of
							information. All of it is controlled by the user on
							a truly free (<em>libre</em>) machine.</dd>
                        <dt>I am an optimist</dt>
                        <dd><q>No problem is insoluble in all conceivable
							circumstances.</q> It is one rare case where the
							validity of the statement is not so important.
							Considering the inventiveness of the human mind and
							the randomness+complexity of the universe if you
							need to solve a problem,
							<abbr title="in my humble opinion">IMHO</abbr>, it
							tends to be beneficial to believe that there is
							always a solution &mdash; as otherwise you cannot do
							anything, so doubting your abilities either equals
							hindering your progress or does not matter &there4;
							to maximise utility you need not lose hope. At least
							that is a good heuristic I try to use every
							day.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a programmer</dt>
                        <dd><code>&lbrace;Code&rbrace;</code> is fun!
							<abbr title="object-oriented programming">OOP</abbr>
							is neat,
							<abbr title="functional programming">FP</abbr> is
							divine. I love coding. Cre&auml;ting new products
							and designing new interfaces, helping other people
							across the globe, collaborating, solving interesting
							problems, banging your head against the wall when
							bugs won&apos;t go away until (finally) getting rid
							of them &mdash; that is what life should be like. I
							am a pythonist. I love <i>Python 3</i>. I also
							sometimes write code in <i>C++</i> and
							<i>JavaScript</i>.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a free (<i>libre</i>) software activist</dt>
                        <dd>To quote <cite>Linus Torvalds</cite>,
							<q>Talk is cheap. Show me the code.</q> Also it is
							<a
							href=
							"http://catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/"
							title=
							"link to 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' book web-site">
								said
							</a>
							that <q>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are
							shallow</q> &mdash; a statement known as
							<i>Linus&apos;s Law</i>. Using
							<abbr
							title="free/libre and open-source software">
								FLOSS</abbr>
							is a question of security, usability and freedom. I
							have a right to know what is happening on my machine
							&mdash; it is mine, and it should do what I tell it
							to do and no more. The code that only a few people
							edit is bound to be buggy (thus &mdash; the quality
							of proprietary software is low) and &there4;
							insecure (full of undiscovered vulnerabilities)
							&mdash; not even considering potential backdoors
							left by developers themselves. Moreover, I have a
							right to adjust my machine to my needs, as
							(occasionally) I need to modify the code
							<i lang="la">et cetera</i>.
							I fully support Richard Stallman&apos;s cause.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a digital privacy advocate and a cryptography
							enthusiast</dt>
                        <dd>Privacy is important. It is your life, and only you
							should decide which parts to share with others and
							which to leave to yourself.</dd>
                        <dt>I am a web-developer</dt>
                        <dd><b>Code the Web!</b> <i>HTML 5</i> is incredible. It
							(together with <i>CSS 3</i>) is just awesome and it
							is growing and evolving very fast. You can do very
							impressive things with it. Though the World Wide Web
							(in and of itself),
							<abbr title="in my humble opinion">IMHO</abbr>, is
							stuck. To my mind, a true system for sharing and
							storing information globally should be decentralised
							(like <a href="https://ipfs.io/"
							title=
							"'InterPlanetary File System' a.k.a. IPFS peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol home page">
								IPFS
							</a>).
							I&apos;ve made some minor contributions to the
							cre&auml;tion of
							<a href="https://www.webplatform.org/">
								<i>WebPlatform.org</i>
							</a>
							and consider following web standards to be very
							important.</dd>

							<abbr title="speculative fiction">SF</abbr>
							(mainly &mdash; fantasy).</li>
						<li>I read po&euml;try for fun and sometimes learn it by

							exist. Who would have thought, huh?</li>
                        <li>I play

                        <li>I like coding and designing apps.</li>
                        <li>I get a kick out of learning new things (I often
							read good physics and mathematics books and
							articles).</li>
                        <li>I delight in all things <i>fantasy</i>.</li>
                        <li>I love <i>GNU&sol;Linux</i> and enjoy tweaking

							I am a hardcore GNU&sol;Linuxoid.</li>
                        <li>I relish doing science (or even
							&lsquo;do&iuml;ng&rsquo; it, if I am feeling
							especially pedantic at the time) and the idea of
							cre&auml;ting something new.</li>
                        <li>I enjoy proving things.
